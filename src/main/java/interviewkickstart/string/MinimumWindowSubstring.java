 * Minimum Window Substring
 * You are given alphanumeric strings s and t. Find the minimum window (substring)
 * in s which contains all the characters of t.
 *
 * Example One
 * {
 * "s": "AYZABOBECODXBANC",
 * "t": "ABC"
 * }
 * Output:
 * "BANC"
 * The minimum window is "BANC", which contains all letters - 'A' 'B' and 'C'. We cannot find a window of smaller length than "BANC".
 *
 * Example Two
 * {
 * "s": "BACRDESDFBAER",
 * "t": "BAR"
 * }
 * Output:
 * "BACR"
 *
 * Here, we can see that there are 2 smallest windows - "BACR" and "BAER".
 * However, the output is "BACR" because it is the leftmost one.
